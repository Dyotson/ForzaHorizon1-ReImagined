MIT License's terms in the versions in which they were published. From that commit on, the

## Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7

This permission is granted by the copyright holders named above, for the whole of this program.

**Proprietary Components.** In this section, a "Proprietary Component" is software that someone
other than the licensors of this program wrote and distributes under its own terms, and that is
one of the following, as its vendor released it:

1. NVIDIA's DLSS, NGX and Streamline runtime libraries (for example `nvngx_dlss.dll`), and the
   headers and loader libraries that NVIDIA's SDKs supply for them;
2. graphics drivers: the Vulkan, Direct3D, OpenGL or other graphics-API implementations and
   their user-space components, from NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple or any other GPU vendor;
3. OpenXR runtimes and their API layers, such as SteamVR, the Meta (Oculus) runtime and the
   Virtual Desktop streamer;
4. the Discord desktop client, which the game reaches through Discord's local IPC;
5. platform system libraries: the libraries of the operating system the program runs on
   (Windows, macOS or Linux), and Microsoft's C and C++ runtime libraries and Windows SDK
   import libraries.

**The permission.** You may link this program, or a work based on it, with a Proprietary
Component, load a Proprietary Component at run time from it (including one that the user
installed, that the operating system or driver supplies, or that the launcher downloaded from
its vendor), and otherwise combine it with a Proprietary Component, and you may convey the
resulting combination, without the GNU General Public License requiring the Proprietary
Component, or its source code, to be licensed under the GNU General Public License or to be part
of the Corresponding Source.

**What stays the same.**

- The permission is limited to the Proprietary Components listed above. Software does not
  become a Proprietary Component merely because it is loaded at run time, renders graphics or
  runs on a GPU.
- Everything else stays under the GNU General Public License: this program, your changes to it,
  and any code you write to connect it to a Proprietary Component (a wrapper, shim, plugin or
  adapter). You must convey all of it under the GNU General Public License, with its
  Corresponding Source.
- The permission does not license a Proprietary Component. It stays under its vendor's own
  terms, and you must follow them when you distribute it.
- If you modify this program, you may extend this permission to your version, but you are not
  obliged to. If you do not want to, delete this section from your version.

## Third-party components

Files and directories of other holders keep their own licenses and notices; the relicensing of
this project does not change them.

| Where | What | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forza-recomp/thirdparty/` | Discord RPC, RapidJSON, bc7enc_rdo, OpenXR headers (details in its `README.md` and the license files beside each) | MIT; MIT; MIT or public domain; Apache-2.0 or MIT |
| `forza-recomp/LICENSE-Pinyon-Shift` | notice for code adapted from Pinyon Shift | BSD-3-Clause |
| `launcher/forza_launcher/haptics/vendor/` | HorizonHaptics (Haritha Rathnayake) | MIT |
| `launcher/forza_launcher/ui/controller_art/` | Gamepad Viewer artwork (Michaël Ferrand) | MIT |
| `tools/native_menu/icons/` | Font Awesome Free icons (Fonticons, Inc.) | CC BY 4.0 |
| `patches/rexglue-sdk/` | the old patch series for the ReXGlue SDK (kept for reference, no longer applied) | BSD-3-Clause for the parts derived from the SDK, with its notices |

The ReXGlue SDK (Tom Clay and contributors, with code derived from Xenia) and ReIGlue, this
project's fork of it, are separate projects under their own license (BSD-3-Clause) and are not
covered by this notice. The binaries that the launcher builds and runs include them, and the
packages carry their license under `licenses/`. Downloaded tools (LLVM, CMake, Ninja, xwin,
Real-ESRGAN) and the Microsoft C++ runtime and Windows SDK keep their own licenses too.

Screenshots in `docs/images/` and `screenshots/` show the game, which is (c) Microsoft. They
illustrate the documentation; this license grants no rights to the game's content.
