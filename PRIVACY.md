# Privacy policy

This policy covers Forza Horizon 1: ReImagined: the Windows installer, the Linux packages, the launcher, the game the launcher builds on your PC, and the project's public Forza Live server. It says what is sent over the network, when, where it goes, what is stored and for how long, what is public, and how to turn each thing off.

Last updated: 2026-10-28. Every change to this policy is a change to this file, so its history on GitHub lists them: https://github.com/FH1-ReImagined/ForzaHorizon1-ReImagined/commits/main/PRIVACY.md

## In short

- The launcher and the game have no analytics, no telemetry and no advertising. Crash reports are never sent by the launcher on its own.
- These features are on by default and send data over the network:
  - online play on the project's public Forza Live server;
  - after each session online: sharing shader lists with that server, and asking it for your co-op campaign results;
  - a check for launcher updates on GitHub each time the launcher opens;
  - your activity in the game, shown through the Discord desktop app if it is running.
- One choice turns all of them off: "Online features" in the Windows installer, or the same question the launcher asks the first time it opens on Linux. You can also turn each one off later in the launcher; see "How to turn each thing off".
- Separately, on Windows with an NVIDIA graphics card, the first Play downloads NVIDIA's DLSS runtime from GitHub, and actions you start (Build, Make HD pack) download tools. See "Downloads".
- Settings > Online > Server > "Offline" stops all contact with game servers.
- When you play online, the server receives your gamertag, a random player ID (your XUID) and your IP addresses. Other players see your gamertag and XUID.
- Traffic to the game server is not encrypted. That includes chat messages and your friends key.
- The public server keeps most records with no time limit. Its status page and leaderboards are public.

## Who is involved

- Your PC runs the launcher and the game.
- The project maintainer runs the public Forza Live server, forza-reimagined.playit.plus. You reach it through a tunnel run by playit.gg. playit.gg therefore sees your IP address and carries your game traffic, which is not encrypted, so playit.gg can read it.
- GitHub hosts the releases, the update check, most downloads and the issue tracker. GitHub sees your IP address whenever the launcher or your browser contacts it.
- Microsoft, Discord and Flathub are involved only in the cases described below.
- If you play on a server that you or a friend host ("My own server"), that server's operator receives what this policy says goes to "the server". This policy does not cover what that operator does with it.

- Discord: https://discord.com/privacy

## What the launcher sends

### Update check (on by default)

- What: an HTTPS request to api.github.com that asks for this project's latest release. It names the launcher and its version in its User-Agent header and contains nothing else about you.
- When: 1.5 seconds after the launcher opens (packaged launchers only, not a source checkout), and when you click "Check for updates" on the About page.
- Turn off: About > "Check for updates when the launcher opens".
- An update is downloaded only when you click "Download update" or "Update and restart". It comes from this project's GitHub releases, and the launcher checks its SHA-256 checksum before using it.

### Shader-list sharing (on by default when you play online)

- What: after each game session, the launcher sends the server descriptions of the graphics pipelines the game built: shader hashes, render settings, how to rebuild each shader from your own game files, and which kind of render-target path your graphics card supports. Each entry is sent once; shader_share.json on your PC records what was sent. No game code or data, file paths, gamertag or logs are sent.
- The request headers carry your XUID and your friends key, so that the server counts each player once. The request uses plain HTTP, so it is not encrypted.
- Where: the server you play on (the public server or your own). Nothing is sent in "Offline" or "This PC" mode.
- What the server keeps: for each entry, a hashed form of your XUID, with no time limit, and counters per day that are cleared every day. It publishes only entries that several players reported, without player IDs.
- Turn off: Settings > Online > "Share shader list". "Offline" and "This PC" also stop it.
- Setup > "Prebuild shaders" downloads the published list from the same server. That request sends only a version string. "Share shader list" does not stop this download; "Offline" or "This PC" does.

### Co-op campaign results (on by default when you play online)

- What: after each session on "Public server" or "My own server", the launcher asks the server for your pending co-op campaign results, then confirms the ones it handled. It does this only when you have a save and a Forza Live identity on this PC. These requests carry your XUID and friends key over plain HTTP. The answer can include the gamertag of the player who hosted the event.
- Turn off: Settings > Online > "Co-op campaign results". "Offline" and "This PC" also stop it.

### Downloads

Each of these downloads shows the site it comes from your IP address, and its User-Agent header names the launcher. Nothing else about you is sent. Unless noted, the launcher checks each file against a SHA-256 checksum kept in its own code. None of them is part of the "Online features" choice: they run only when you start the action named, or, for DLSS, when you press Play.

- Build (the first time, or when a tool is missing): LLVM, CMake and Ninja from GitHub. On Linux, also the ReXGlue SDK from GitHub.
- Build on Windows without Visual Studio 2022: the xwin tool from GitHub. xwin then downloads Microsoft's C++ runtime and Windows SDK files from Microsoft's servers. Only the xwin archive is checked against a checksum kept in the launcher; the files xwin downloads from Microsoft are not. This runs only after you tick "I accept Microsoft's license terms...".
- Make HD pack: the Real-ESRGAN upscaler from GitHub, after you confirm.
- NVIDIA DLSS (Windows with an NVIDIA graphics card): when you press Play, the launcher downloads NVIDIA's DLSS runtime (about 56 MB) and its license from NVIDIA's repository on GitHub, if they are not on your PC yet. With Settings > Display > "Graphics API" set to Vulkan (the default), this happens even when DLSS is off, so that the in-game menu can turn DLSS on later. To avoid it, set "Graphics API" to Direct3D 12 and leave "NVIDIA DLSS" and "NVIDIA DLAA" off. If the download fails, the game still starts.

### Crash reports

- The launcher uploads nothing after a crash. It shows a report that you can read and edit, then "Copy report", "Save report..." or "Open GitHub issue".
- "Open GitHub issue" opens your browser at a new GitHub issue with the report filled in. The report travels in the page address, so your browser sends it to github.com as soon as the page loads, before you press Submit. A report too long for that is copied to the clipboard instead.
- The report contains:
  - the launcher and game versions and your operating system version;
  - your CPU, graphics card, RAM and video memory;
  - your online and profile mode and some launch settings;
  - the crash details and up to 200 lines of the game's log.
- Before you see the report, the launcher tries to remove file paths with your user name, XUIDs and other IDs of that form, IPv4 addresses, web addresses and tokens. This is best effort. It does not remove gamertags or chat messages, which the log can contain. GitHub issues are public, so read the report before you post it.
- If the game crashes in a way its own crash handler does not catch (for example inside the graphics driver), Windows Error Reporting, which is part of Windows, may send data about the crash to Microsoft, depending on your Windows settings. The project does not receive that data.

### Links

Buttons that open web pages (the project on GitHub, this policy, Microsoft's license, SteamVR's store page, WiVRn) open your browser. The launcher itself sends nothing for them.

## What the game sends

### Online play (Forza Live)

Settings > Online > Server has four choices. "Public server" is the default. "This PC" runs a server on your own PC that only you use. "My own server" connects to a server that you or a friend host. "Offline" connects to no server.

While a server is set, the game sends it the following every few seconds, from the moment the game starts until you quit:
- your XUID, a random player ID created on your PC the first time you play online;
- your gamertag. If you have not set one in Settings > Profile > Gamertag, the game makes one: your computer's login name where it can read one (on Linux and the Steam Deck it can), otherwise "Driver" and four digits;
- your PC's local network (LAN) IP address and the game's network port;
- your room name and your friends key.

The server also sees the IP address you connect from. On the public server you connect through playit.gg's tunnel, so playit.gg sees it. These messages are sent even when "Sign in to Xbox LIVE" is off. Only "Offline" stops them.

While "Sign in to Xbox LIVE" is on (the default), the game also:
- fetches the list of players in your room every 3 seconds: their gamertags, XUIDs, status and cars;
- publishes your presence: your online status, your current car and the session you host;
- sends your matchmaking searches and the sessions you host, and Xbox LIVE skill stats around online races;
- syncs your friends list every 10 seconds, and sends the friend requests, blocks and gamertag searches you make;
- sends the chat messages you write, and the list of sessions you are in;
- in Horizon World free roam, sends your car's in-game position, heading and speed four times a second, for head-to-head challenges (Settings > Online > "Head-to-head challenges" turns this off);
- sends an invite only when you send one ("Show game invites" controls whether invites from others are shown to you);
- uses the server's title services over plain HTTP: sign-in (gamertag and career level), profile progress (XP, credits, race history), race scores and lap times, Rivals ghost replays, photos you upload or share (image, preview, title, description), car clubs and the cars shared in them, auctions and gifts, and Message Center checks. Each of these requests carries your XUID and friends key.

None of this traffic is encrypted.

Turning "Sign in to Xbox LIVE" off stops the list above, but it does not hide you. The server still receives the messages described before it, counts you as online, lists you on its status page, and gives the players in your room your gamertag and XUID. Only "Offline" hides you.

Your IP address and other players:
- On the public server, which you reach through playit.gg, the server does not give other players your IP address.
- On a server you connect to directly ("My own server" without a tunnel), the server gives the other players in your room your public IP address and port and your LAN IP address and port, and the game connects to them directly when it can. They can then see your public IP address.

### Discord activity (on by default)

- If the Discord desktop app is running, the game tells it what you are doing (for example "Exploring Colorado", "Racing online", or the number of players in an online lobby) and when you started. This goes to the Discord app on your PC over a local connection. Discord then shows it to your Discord contacts, under Discord's own privacy settings and privacy policy. Your gamertag, XUID and IP address are not part of it.
- Turn off: Settings > Online > "Share activity on Discord".

### What stays on your PC

- Controller haptics (DualSense adaptive triggers and Xbox trigger rumble, off by default) send car data from the game to the launcher over 127.0.0.1 only.
- VR (off by default) talks only to your PC's OpenXR runtime. Streaming to a headset, for example with WiVRn over Wi-Fi, is that runtime's own traffic.
- "This PC" mode runs the server on 127.0.0.1 only.
- Hardware detection reads your graphics card, CPU and RAM with tools on your PC. It is used to recommend settings, and in crash reports that you choose to send.
- The first time you play online on Windows, Windows Firewall may ask whether to allow the game on networks.

## What the installer and the packages do

- Windows installer: it shows this policy and the "Online features" choice (ticked by default; untick it to turn all of the features above off). It installs the launcher for your user account only, by default in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ForzaHorizon1-ReImagined, and adds a Start menu entry, a desktop shortcut (which you can untick) and an uninstall entry. It writes your "Online features" choice to install_options.json in the install folder, where the launcher reads it. When you install an update with "Online features" ticked, your current launcher settings stay as they are. For a silent install, /ONLINE=no turns the features off.
- If the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 x64 runtime is missing, the installer says so before installing, then installs that runtime for all users of the PC, and Windows asks for administrator approval. The runtime is included in the installer, so the installer itself downloads nothing. Uninstalling leaves the runtime installed.
- If "Start the launcher" is ticked on the installer's last page, the launcher starts, and with "Online features" on, its update check runs.
- Linux .tar.gz: install.sh copies files into ~/.local/share/forza-reimagined and adds a menu entry. It uses no network. The first time the launcher opens, it asks the "Online features" question.
- Flatpak: Flatpak itself downloads the Freedesktop runtime and an LLVM extension from Flathub, after asking you. The first time the launcher opens, it asks the "Online features" question.

## What is stored on your PC

- The launcher's own files, in %APPDATA%\ForzaReImagined (Windows) or ~/.config/forza-reimagined (Linux):
  - launcher.json, your settings;
  - launcher.log, the launcher's errors with technical details. It starts over at 2 MB and keeps one older copy;
  - updates, the launcher updates you downloaded. In the Flatpak they go to ~/Downloads/ForzaHorizon1-ReImagined instead.
- Game data, in %LOCALAPPDATA%\ForzaReImagined (Windows; older installs used Documents\forza) or ~/.local/share/forza (Linux), or in a folder you chose in the launcher:
  - saves, the built game, downloaded tools and shader caches;
  - forza.log, the game's log;
  - shader_share.json, which records the shader entries already sent;
  - live_identity.txt, which holds your XUID, gamertag and friends key;
  - with "This PC": the local server's data in live_server, including its server.log and its player and friends records;
  - with "Continue a Xenia Canary save": a copy of that save in a xenia-<XUID> folder.
- In the Flatpak, both folders are inside ~/.var/app/io.github.dyotson.ForzaHorizon1ReImagined.
- Uninstalling keeps all of these files. Delete the folders yourself to remove them.
- forza.log can record your LAN IP address, your public IP address (on a server you connect to directly), the server's address, your country and language settings, other players' IP addresses, gamertags and XUIDs, and the chat messages you send and receive. Check it before you attach it to a public issue.
- Keep live_identity.txt private. Its friends key is the secret that proves to the server that your friends list is yours.

## What the public server keeps, and for how long

Records are kept by XUID.
- Player record: gamertag, last sign-in time, number of sign-ins, career level and progress, credits, and details of your last race. No time limit.
- Friends: your gamertag, when you were last seen, a hash of your friends key, and your friends, friend requests, blocks and chat mutes. If you have no friends, requests or blocks, the record is removed when the server restarts more than 180 days after you were last seen. Otherwise there is no time limit.
- Scores and Rivals ghosts: your best score on each leaderboard, with gamertag, date, car, class and assists, and your best ghost replay. A new best replaces the old one. No time limit. The maintainer may use the driven lines in ghost replays to draw roads on the map on the project website; no names or player IDs are shown there.
- Skill stats: rating and number of games, with gamertag. No time limit.
- Photos you upload: image, preview, title, description and time, up to 100 per player. You can remove shared photos in the game, and the oldest can be replaced. No time limit.
- Car clubs, auctions and gifts: club memberships, roles and history, shared cars, auction listings and bids, and gifts with their messages. No time limit.
- Message Center notifications: removed when you clear them. After 30 days they are no longer shown, but they are not deleted.
- Co-op campaign results: removed once they are handled, or after 30 days.
- Shader lists: see "Shader-list sharing" above.
- Community events, only if an organizer enrolled you: your XUID, a hash of your friends key, attendance times and rewards. No time limit.
- Chat: the last 200 messages are held in memory, where only the server's administrator can read them. They are lost when the server restarts and are not written to disk. Mutes and bans set by the administrator are stored until they expire.
- Connection state: for the players online at that moment, the server writes their addresses and ports, session token, XUID, gamertag, room and presence to a file every 30 seconds, so that a restart does not drop them. The file is overwritten, not deleted.
- Backups: the server may keep one previous copy of each of its data files.
- Server log: the log records sign-ins (gamertag, XUID, room and the address and ports the player connected from), web requests with the address they came from, profile and race updates, scores, friend and block actions, and gift messages. Chat text is not logged. For players who come through the playit.gg tunnel, the log shows the tunnel's address, not theirs. The log is not published. There is no fixed period after which it is deleted yet.

To have your records on the public server removed, see "Contact".

## What is public

- The server's status page (http://forza-reimagined.playit.plus:56678/ and /status), for everyone on the internet. For every player online at that moment it shows the gamertag, XUID, room, time online, data relayed, presence status and session, and matchmaking sessions. It also shows the open Horizon Worlds with the host's gamertag and the gamertag and XUID of whoever asked for an event, the head-to-head challenges with both players' gamertags, and the in-game position, heading and speed of each player who sends one in Horizon World free roam. It shows no IP addresses.
- Leaderboards (/leaderboards on the same address, and the project website https://forza.dyotson.dev, updated daily): gamertag, score, car, class, date, and a player ID made from your XUID and a secret. A score stays published for as long as it is on the server.
- Treat these as public too, since the game shows them to players through the server:
  - your gamertag, XUID, presence and car (to players in your room);
  - your scores and ghost replays;
  - your shared photos, with your gamertag and XUID;
  - in the car club invite list, the gamertag, XUID, career level and online XP of every player who has signed in to the server and is not in a club.
- The published shader list, which contains no player IDs.
- Your Discord activity, for your Discord contacts.
- Anything you post in a GitHub issue.

## How to turn each thing off

- Everything in "In short" at once: untick "Online features" in the Windows installer, or answer the launcher's first-run question with it unticked.
- All contact with game servers: Settings > Online > Server > "Offline". ("This PC" keeps everything on your own PC.)
- Room list, presence, friends, chat, stats and title services: Settings > Online > "Sign in to Xbox LIVE" off. You stay visible to the server and your room; see "Online play".
- Position sharing in free roam: Settings > Online > "Head-to-head challenges".
- Invites from others: Settings > Online > "Show game invites".
- Shader-list sharing: Settings > Online > "Share shader list".
- Co-op campaign results: Settings > Online > "Co-op campaign results".
- Update check: About > "Check for updates when the launcher opens".
- Discord activity: Settings > Online > "Share activity on Discord".
- Your computer's login name as gamertag: set Settings > Profile > Gamertag.
- The DLSS download: Settings > Display > "Graphics API" set to Direct3D 12, with "NVIDIA DLSS" and "NVIDIA DLAA" off.

## Contact

For questions or corrections, or to ask for your records on the public server to be removed, open an issue at https://github.com/FH1-ReImagined/ForzaHorizon1-ReImagined/issues. Issues are public. Include your gamertag, but never post your friends key or the contents of live_identity.txt.
