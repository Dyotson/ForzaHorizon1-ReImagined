# ReXGlue SDK patches we carry

`patches/rexglue-sdk/` holds this project's patches to the ReXGlue SDK (nightly 0.10.0.24,
commit `bd833a2`); `tools/build_rexglue_sdk.sh` applies them to the clone
`~/rexglue-sdk-src-forza` and installs the patched GPU plugin, runtime and codegen tool into
the overlay `~/rexglue-sdk-patched-forza`. Patches 0001-0035 came from RecompiledHaloReach,
whose `docs/sdk_patches.md` describes each one (the numbers match; this repo leaves out
0010, 0012, 0014, 0024, 0026 and 0027). Patches written here (0036, 0038 and 0039 for both
projects, measured in this game's races; RecompiledHaloReach `docs/perf.md` has the profile; 0040 and 0041 are this
project's alone):

| Patch | Area | What changes | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0036 | Vulkan shared memory uploads | An upload of vertex or index data the CPU rewrote no longer ends the current render pass when no draw in it has read the uploaded pages: it is recorded before the render pass, and the uploads hoisted there share one barrier pair (`vulkan_hoist_shared_memory_uploads`) | Races at 144 ran 52,000 render pass instances and 133,000 barriers a second, nearly all for these uploads (10,600 and 27,000 with the patch) |
| 0037 | Video mode (runtime) | The guest refresh rate (`video_mode_refresh_rate`, its range and `VdQueryVideoMode`'s clamp) may go up to 480 Hz instead of 240 | 144 fps (and other rates above 120) can keep the game's divider of two: a 288 Hz guest vblank. With a 144 Hz vblank and no divider, the emulated GPU's swap waits (which end on a vblank, patch 0030) turn every frame that misses 6.9 ms into a 13.9 ms one: free roam made 72 fps at a 144 fps target. `docs/framerate.md` |
| 0038 | Vulkan submission | The deferred command buffer is replayed into Vulkan and submitted on a "Vulkan Submission" thread instead of the GPU command processor thread (`vulkan_threaded_submission`) | The replay took 11% of the command processor thread, which bounds the races above 60 fps |
| 0039 | Shared memory | `clear_memory_page_state` off by default, as in Xenia (`--clear_memory_page_state=true` restores the SDK's default) | On, every page the CPU wrote and the GPU read was uploaded again after every frame: 74,000 uploads (2 GB) a second in a race at 144, 1,800 without |
| 0040 | Keyboard and mouse (runtime) | The left stick's keys ramp (`mnk_stick_ramp`, default 0.2 s: 60 % at once, full lock over the ramp, released in half of it); the mouse drives the right stick by its speed, low-passed over the game's polls (1000 px/s is half the stick at sensitivity 1, five times the SDK's old scale); `Shift`, `Control` and `Alt` work as bindings on their own | Steering with keys was full lock at once; a mouse moved at normal speeds stayed inside the game's dead zone of the look stick; a key bound to a modifier never fired. `docs/playing.md` |
| 0041 | Resolve readback (both backends) | `readback_resolve_min_length` and `readback_resolve_max_length` (bytes, 0 = no limit): with `readback_resolve` on, resolves that write fewer or more bytes than that are not copied back to guest memory | The game needs resolve readback only for its car pictures (resolves of 262,144 to 884,736 bytes); copying back every frame's resolves cost races at 144 fps up to a quarter of their speed. `docs/perf.md` |

0037 is in `librexruntime.so`, so the overlay carries a patched runtime (as for 0028).
Without it the game falls back on its own: `src/hooks/frame_time.cpp` reads the setting's
range and uses a divider of one when twice the frame rate does not fit.
