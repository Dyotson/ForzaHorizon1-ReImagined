# DLC and Title Update 4

Status of the downloadable content (issues #5, #9, #16, #17, #18) and of Title Update 4
(#15). Newest findings first within each section.

## Title Update 4

### What the update is

`Forza Horizon (World) (v4) (4000D145) (Title Update)`: an STFS package, content type
`0xB0000` (`4D5309C9/000B0000/tu00000001_00000000`), media id `4000D145`, base version 12.
Files: `default.xexp` (2.8 MB), `XMediaFacade_default.xexp`, `SpeechFacade_default.xexp`
(delta patches, module flags `0x50`, compression type 3) and `media.zip` (10.9 MB).

The executable it updates (`0.0.0.12` -> `0.0.4.12`) is not byte-for-byte the one in this
project (`0.0.0.7`, media id `2B7A1346`): the patch's source signature hash does not match,
and the header delta copies bytes from a header laid out differently (security info right
after the optional header table, the header data back to back; this copy has 0x80 bytes of
zeros after the table, 16-byte aligned header data and a zeroed RSA signature). The code is
the same: with the header repacked to the original layout, the update's block hashes pass
and 370 of the 371 page groups of the patched image match the update's page digests. The
one that does not is `0x83610000-0x8361FFFF` (in `.edata`'s page, copied unchanged from
this copy's `0x83520000`: data, not code). The facades patch with every page group
verified.

### Applying it: `tools/apply_title_update.py`

    tools/apply_title_update.py BASE_XEX TITLE_UPDATE OUT_XEX

`TITLE_UPDATE` is the package, a zip holding it, a folder, or a bare `.xexp`. Writes the
patched `default.xex` (unencrypted, one "basic" block), the patched facade DLLs next to it,
and the update's other files under `OUT_DIR/update/` (the folder to mount as `update:`).
Pure Python (`tools/lzx_delta.py` is a port of libmspack's LZX decoder with a preloaded
window; AES uses `cryptography` or `openssl` when present). About 2 s.

How it checks itself: the patched headers must parse with consistent sizes, every patch
block must match its SHA-1 (so the image key is right), and the result is checked against
the XEX page digest chain (`SHA-1(pages of descriptor i + descriptor i)` is stored in
descriptor i-1, descriptor 0's in the security info's section digest). Digests the header
delta copied from the other copy's headers are rebuilt from the verified pages; ranges that
still fail are reported, and the tool refuses when one is in code.

Notes:
- ReXGlue's codegen already applies a `default.xexp` that sits next to the input XEX
  (`UserModule::LoadFromFile` looks for a sibling `.xexp`), but through
  `XexModule::ApplyPatch`, which (from Xenia) bounds the header records by the first
  record's length: right for `default.xexp` (one record), wrong for the facades' patches
  (several), and it fails on this copy's headers anyway. The pre-patched XEX avoids both.
- The base game already asks for `update:\media.zip` (Xenia's log: "ResolvePath(update:\
  media.zip) failed"). The SDK mounts `update:` from its `update_data_root` setting.

### Building it

    python3 tools/apply_title_update.py extracted/game/default.xex <TU package or zip> extracted/tu4/default.xex
    cmake -S forza-recomp -B forza-recomp/out/build/linux-tu4 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/rexglue-sdk-nightly/0.10.0.24/linux-amd64 \
      -DFORZA_TITLE_UPDATE=4
    FORZA_BUILD=linux-tu4 tools/build.sh
    FORZA_BUILD=linux-tu4 tools/play.sh

- `-DFORZA_TITLE_UPDATE=4` picks `forza_manifest_tu4.toml` (input `extracted/tu4/`, hints in
  `hints_tu4/`, output `generated_tu4/`; codegen rewrites `generated/rexglue.cmake` with
  the paths of the manifest that ran, so each build includes its own copy, made at
  configure time; after a TU4 codegen run git shows that file changed: `git checkout` it). Both
  versions build from the same tree into separate build folders; the base build is
  unchanged.
- Hints: `tools/tu_address_map.py` maps base addresses to TU4 ones (functions paired
  through both images' `.pdata`, aligned in order with difflib on normalized code; changed
  functions paired by similarity within their gap; data addresses through the lis/addi
  pairs of matched code). It ported every file of `hints/` to `hints_tu4/` (entries it could
  not map are commented out), then `tools/find_missing_entries.py` (+87) and
  `tools/find_orphan_functions.py` (+202) were run on the TU4 output until they found
  only what they find on the base (5 and 8 rejects). `hints_tu4/tu4_fixes.toml`: one
  function end (`sub_827611D8`) the scanner cut short.
- Hooks: sources name guest functions and addresses as in the base executable.
  `src/tu4_addresses.h` (written by `tu_address_map.py --cpp forza-recomp/src ...`)
  renames each `sub_XXXXXXXX`/`__imp__sub_XXXXXXXX` they use and maps each
  `FORZA_ADDR(0x...)` constant; `src/platform/guest_addr.h` includes it in a TU4 build.
  Entries marked "check" sit in functions the update changed; each was reviewed against
  the TU4 code (see "Online" below). Struct layouts the update changed are picked with
  `FORZA_TU4` (`guest_addr.h`).
- Runtime: the TU4 build mounts the patched files' folder as `update:` (the SDK's
  `update_data_root`, default `tu4` next to the game folder) and links
  `game:\default.xex` and the two facades to it. TU4 looks the facades' exports up
  again and again; the SDK made a new thunk for each lookup and ran out within a second,
  so `src/kernel/proc_address_cache.cpp` gives each (module, ordinal, caller) its first
  thunk again.
- Cost: codegen about 70 s, a full build about 15 minutes at -j4 on this machine.

### For the launcher

- `apply_title_update.py BASE_XEX TU_PACKAGE OUT_XEX` writes `default.xex`, both facades
  and `media.zip` into OUT_XEX's folder; that folder is the game's `update:`.
- Build with `-DFORZA_TITLE_UPDATE=4` from `forza_manifest_tu4.toml`, rewriting its
  `../extracted/tu4` paths (the three `file_path`s and `game_root`) to that folder. Not
  `forza_manifest.toml` with the patched XEX: the base hints are at base addresses.
- Run with `--update_data_root=<that folder>` (the default is `tu4` next to the game
  folder). `--game_data_root` stays the disc's files.

### Status

- TU4 reaches the main menu, which lists HORIZON RALLY next to Single Player and
  Multiplayer (the base has no such entry). With a profile without progress the game says
  "You must earn a yellow wristband in Horizon Single Player before you can enter Horizon
  Rally" (game rule). With a Xenia save, Horizon Rally loads its map and resumes the rally
  progress; its events and championships play to the end and are saved, without the
  co-driver's voice ("Horizon Rally" below); the free roam pause menu lists 1000 CLUB,
  which says "not available because you are not signed into Xbox LIVE" when offline;
  signed in (Forza Live server) it opens (tutorial, then the challenge cards); its
  challenges can be completed and are kept in the save, and the server has its leaderboard
  ("The 1000 Club" below).
- Saves: TU4 converts a profile save when it loads it (`ForzaProfile/VersionFlags` goes
  from 0 to version 4, flags 2; a `NeedsAA` file appears). The base build then refuses it:
  "MISSING TITLE UPDATE: Your profile save game requires the latest title update". Going
  to TU4 is one way: keep a copy of the profile folder to go back.

### Online (#20)

Checked 2026-10-14 with two TU4 games (DriverA, DriverB) and one base game (BaseC) on a
local Forza Live server, each with its own scratch copy of a Xenia career save (TU4
converts it) and its own `XDG_DATA_HOME` (the online identity file lives there).

What the update changed for the hooks, and the fixes:

- Mapping (`tools/tu_address_map.py`): the 13 "check" functions and 5 call sites were
  compared with the TU4 code (the generated code of both builds carries the disassembly,
  so a base function and its TU4 pair diff directly, branch targets mapped). Two were
  wrong, both paired by the code around them: the player list's constructor
  `sub_8247F018` (paired with `sub_824AE6B0`, a tree header's: 16-byte node, flags) and
  its clear `sub_828736E0` (paired with another list type's clear); TU4 has them at
  `sub_825A1EB8` and `sub_824B06A0`, the same code. The tool now places a function start
  the alignment left out by its callers: each call site in a matched function of the same
  length names the new target (a majority of at least 2, 80 %); such entries are marked
  "check" only when the code differs. The other 11 and the 5 call sites (each call site's
  call goes to the mapped function) are right; the changes in them: the launch passes a
  new flag to `sub_825548A0`, `sub_828786E8` checks one more condition per player, the
  session teardown `sub_82CF7278` skips its message pump when a field is clear. None of
  that touches what the hooks do. The hints (`hints_tu4/`) map the same with the new tool.
- The online game object grew: TU4 put 4 bytes in front of the game options (the preset
  at +0x1B8, the track +0x1BC, MaxPlayers/MaxAIPlayers +0x1D0/+0x1D1, AI difficulty
  +0x44E) and 8 at their end (0x2DC bytes, was 0x2D0), so everything after them moved
  (next round ready/options +0x490/+0x494, round counter +0x7F4, intermission +0x7FC/
  +0x800, the launch check +0x87C/+0x880). The fields before the options (mode, state, in
  game, players, host, launch time) and the vtable slots the hooks call did not move.
  Found by diffing the field offsets of every matched function in the online code
  (`0x82860000-0x828A0000`); `world_events.cpp` and `world_drop_in.cpp` use the TU4
  offsets in a TU4 build. Read with the base offsets, the world hooks would have taken
  every round for an event (preset 0) and written the intermission into other fields.
- Title services: TU4 asks for the playlists with `Hopper.GetListEx` (each hopper also
  has `requiredOfferId`, a u64 after `intermissionTimeMs`); with the server's empty
  answer the game showed only its default playlist ("The Forza Horizon service is not
  available"). The server answers it (no offer needed). A dump of TU4's service records
  from a running game (`server/forza_xtsw_all.py`) found the other 292 unchanged and 7
  new: `GetListEx`, `Challenge.ChallengeCompleted(carId u16, challengeThumbprint u32)`
  (the 1000 Club; no results), `SharedCar.CreateEx` / `GetClubCarsEx` (the car data with
  `hasRallyUpgrades`, rows with `contentId`), now handled like `Create` / `GetClubCars`.

Results (TU4 + TU4):

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Sign-in (Gold), party lobby, Find Game | playlists listed (after `GetListEx`) |
| Horizon World | B alone: the world started at once (free roam HUD); A was placed into B's world, JUMP IN, both in the world, each console's car list has the other's car at the other's position |
| Event (`/world/event`, event 4, 1 lap) | both to the event lobby: 2 humans + 6 CPU drivers, INTERMISSION from 30, class B cars; the race with 8 cars (each console runs 3 CPU drivers, sees the other's 3), A saw B's car and tag; CPU level Easy (2 of 8 human); after the race each console removed only its own CPU drivers, both back in the world's free roam; online race scores submitted, XP and credits given |
| Head-to-head | A drove up behind B (29 m), X: B got the prompt, accepted; both "race to the Wind Farm", GPS route on both minimaps; B's game closed: A "YOU WIN: DriverB left" |
| Rivals | GoPro Millennia Masters: Rivals screen (`GetRivalAndPersonalBest`, `GetBestScores`), Rivals race started and quit (`WriteRaceStatsEx`); a finished lap (a rival time) was not driven |
| 1000 Club, signed in | opens (tutorial, challenge cards, `Scoreboard.GetRows`), challenges begun in a car; a challenge completed and kept, the leaderboard (below) |
| Host leaves | when B quit, A became the world's host |

TU4 and base together: they can't play together. The base game placed into a TU4 world
joined the session and left it within 60 ms ("session teardown"), then hosted a world of
its own; a TU4 game placed into a base world did the same. No crash, but the next player
of either version could be sent into the other version's world and end up alone too. So a
TU4 build signs in to the server's room with "#TU4" added (`LiveRoom()`,
`src/kernel/identity.cpp`): matchmaking, the friends list and invites only see players of
the same version. Tested: base BaseC and TU4 DriverA each hosted their own world (no
cross-version join), TU4 DriverB was placed into DriverA's.

### Horizon Rally (#16)

Checked 2026-10-14/15 with the TU4 build, offline, a scratch copy of the Xenia career save
(rally progress: the Rally Heats event in progress) and scripted driving, at 30, 60 and
144 fps.

- The mode's data: `gamedb.slt` (TU4's media.zip) has the 7 championships (`Events`
  271-277, `MS_RALLY_01`-`07`, B to R class, 10,000-50,000 Cr), each of 4 stages
  (`MultiStageSeriesEvents` / `MultiStageSeriesRaces`: stages 1-3 are `RALLY_nA`-`nC`,
  stage 4 `RALLY_nD`, 8-12 km), and `RALLY_HEATS` (event 279, the qualifier in a given
  Impreza). Each stage is a `ColoradoDirt` track whose `RouteId` names the AI route in the
  Rally package (`media/AIOpenWorld/coloradodirt/Ribbon_00/route_NNN.owt`; a route can run
  on past the stage's finish).
- Driving: `tools/owt_path.py` makes an autodrive path from a stage's route,
  `tools/autodrive.py` with `AD_OPEN=1 AD_PATH_LOAD=<path>` drives it (a TU4 game's car list
  is at `0x833CAAE4`) and stops when the game holds the car after the finish. The car keeps
  within 1-4 m of the route at 25-30 m/s, with a few crashes at 34 m/s; it finishes last
  (50th, 1.5-2 times the winners' totals), which is enough to play everything but the
  final.
- **Played:** HORIZON RALLY from the main menu loaded the Rally Heats in progress (26 %);
  finished it (50th of 50: 45,000 Cr, the mileage and assists bonuses); HORIZON
  RECOMMENDS: bought the Lancer Evolution VIII MR (20,000 Cr), the rally conversion
  (8,514 Cr of parts, B 436 -> 497); then the rally hub. Three championships to the end,
  each stage after the other (start menu, countdown, HUD with progress, race clock, splits
  and the rivals around you, pace-note icons, finish gantry, STAGE RESULTS, RALLY
  STANDINGS, and after stage 4 RALLY RESULTS, each total the sum of its stages):

  | Championship | fps | Stages | Total |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Beaumont (B, 10,000 Cr) | 30 | 3:43.312, 2:39.901, 5:08.718, 7:37.371 | 19:09.302 |
  | Montano Plains (A, 15,000 Cr; the game's automatic upgrade to A 597, 10,296 Cr) | 60 | 2:52.767, 4:31.712, 4:36.732, 7:41.341 | 19:42.552 |
  | North Plains (B, 20,000 Cr, night; "Illegal car": the game configured the Lancer back to B 499) | 144 | 3:26.160, 3:17.601, 4:43.562, 8:07.972 | 19:35.295 |

  After each, the hub shows the championship's best time and unlocks the next one (after
  North Plains: The Rockies, A, 25,000 Cr); "To Final" goes down by 10 points per
  championship at 50th (310, 300, 290, 280). No crash or hang in the 3 sessions.
- Timing: the race clock against the log's screenshot times: 60.335 s of clock in
  60.339 s at 30 fps, 60.333 in 60.354 at 60, 60.396 in 60.409 at 144 (94-144 fps in the
  stages).
- Saving: the career is written at the end of each championship and when quitting to the
  main menu (QUIT HORIZON RALLY); not between stages. After a restart the hub showed the
  best times, the unlocked championships, the credits and the car.
- **The co-driver's voice is not heard** (#41): his pace-note icons appear and his bank
  (`CoDriver_EN.fsb`) is loaded, but the sound is the same with Rally Co-Driver ON or OFF.
- Logs: one XMA decode error in 3 hours ("ffmpeg: overflow ... in spectral RLE"), and
  ambient banks opened by bare name (`ResolvePath(AMB_Mountains.fsb) failed`, twice, in a
  North Plains stage), which other runs' logs show for the base game's banks too
  (AMB_FA_Autoshow, AMB_FA_Workshop): not checked whether an ambience goes missing.
- Not played: the other 4 championships and the final (it needs rally points that a
  last place does not give), the Service Area and the All Access Pass.

### The 1000 Club (#17)

Checked 2026-10-14 with the TU4 build, a scratch copy of the Xenia career save (free roam
in the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, car 1398) and a local Forza Live server.

- The challenges are the 1000 Club package's (`2700_pri_65` zip:
  `media/carchallenges/carchallenges_<carId>.xml`, 218 cars, 1145 challenges; TU4's
  `gamedb.slt` has their counts and titles). The Aventador's: ONE EIGHTY SKILL (any
  grade), 4 great near misses, 190 mph for 10 s, a skill road trip, 5 trash cans in 30 s,
  a festival event.
- Flow: pause menu, 1000 CLUB: the tutorial ("Select the My First Challenge achievement"),
  the eligible garage cars, BEGIN CHALLENGES IN THIS CAR; back in free roam the HUD lists
  the car's challenges (1-6, "1000 Club Info"), D-pad up shows CURRENT CAR CHALLENGES.
- **ONE EIGHTY SKILL completed** with scripted input (e-brake and full lock from 20 m/s
  until the car had turned about 150 degrees, then throttle with a little counter-steer;
  the car stopped turning near 180 and drove off the other way; it took one or two tries in
  an open field). The HUD's challenge 1 turned into a medal, and the game sent
  `Challenge.ChallengeCompleted(carId 1398, challengeThumbprint 0xAE6828D3)` and wrote
  `ForzaProfile`. The 1000 CLUB screen then moved on to the next achievements (14 and 20
  medals) and its LEADERBOARDS showed the 1000 Club board (`GetRows` type 5, board 1).
- **Saving:** the medal is kept with the career, which the game saves when leaving single
  player (pause menu, QUIT: `ForzaProfile` and `PlayerDatabase` written). Quit that way and
  restarted: CURRENT CAR CHALLENGES showed the medal on ONE EIGHTY SKILL. Killed right
  after the medal instead (only the `ForzaProfile` write at the medal): after the restart
  the medal was gone (the tutorial's progress was kept), and doing the challenge again
  sent the same `ChallengeCompleted`. So, as for the rest of the career: quit to the title
  screen before closing the game.
- **The leaderboard, two players** (two TU4 games, DriverA and DriverB, each with a fresh
  copy of the save, one server): each did the ONE EIGHTY SKILL (B first); the server kept
  both `ChallengeCompleted`. 1000 CLUB, LEADERBOARDS showed "1 DriverB 1 (medal)
  10/15/2026, 2 DriverA 1 (medal) 10/15/2026", "YOU ARE IN THE TOP 100% OF 2 PLAYERS" on
  A and "TOP 1%" on B; X went through Favorites, Near Me and Global (views 3, 1, 0), same
  rows. The score column is the medal count, the date the latest medal's (UTC). The
  server side is in docs/title_services.md (scoreboards).

## Every package (#18)

The 23 installed packages (`tools/install_dlc.py`), and what the game answers for their
cars (`FORZA_DLC_LOG=1`, `src/debug/dlc_log.cpp`: each IsCarInstalled /
IsCarInstalledAndPurchased / IsCarOnDisc answer is logged once). Car lists come from each
package's database patch (`media/db/patch/*_merge.slt` in its DLC zips); single-car
packages map their offer to a car of the disc's database (`ContentOffersMapping`).
Measured 2026-10-14 with all 23 installed, signed in to the Forza Live server: base build
with the normal profile, TU4 build with a Xenia save, each into free roam.

- Every DLC car counts as installed on both builds, the Rally and 1000 Club cars too
  (the base merges their database patches; TU4's own `gamedb.slt`, in its media.zip,
  already has the 15 Rally cars and the 1600 and 2700 offers). What the expansions add
  besides cars is TU4 code: the Horizon Rally mode and its map (#16) and the 1000 Club
  (#17) exist only in the TU4 build.
- The 12 packages of the second DLC set (1000 Club, Rally, the car packs, VIP) are byte
  for byte the installed ones; `install_dlc.py` needs no change.
- Not checked one by one: each car in the Autoshow and garage (model, audio, thumbnail).
- The failed `DLCRoot` lookups in the log (#5) are the game probing every package for
  optional files (`DLCRootN:\media\dlczips\stringtables.xml`, per-zip
  `media\db\patch\`, `effects\`, `dynamicpost\...` folders): not errors.

## Missing DLC content message (#9)

The text is `TitleUpdate2.str` 0x44E6: "You have cars in your garage that are missing DLC
content. These cars will be unavailable until you re-install the content or connect to
Xbox LIVE." (`Main.str` has an older variant). So it is a garage check (cars whose content
is not available), not a license check of packages. The string ids around it in the
executable: `IDS_MissingContent_DLC`, `IDS_MissingContent_Disc2`, `IDS_GarageMissingContent`
(`0x8209C8EC`).

(in progress)

How it is decided (base addresses): the profile load handler `sub_827A1CD0` shows it
(`TitleUpdate2`, id `0x83310F54` = `IDS_GarageMissingContent`) when a vtable check on the
profile is false and `sub_82500AD8(profile)` is true. That runs
`SELECT COUNT() FROM <profile>Career_Garage WHERE IsCarInstalled(CarId)=0 AND
IsCarOnDisc(CarId)=0` on the game database. The SQL functions are registered in
`sub_8250B9xx`: `IsCarInstalled` = `sub_82502DD8`, `IsCarInstalledAndPurchased` =
`sub_82502E18`, `IsCarOnDisc` = `sub_824F1A80` (both installed checks go through a cache,
`sub_82502CB8`). So the message means: the save's garage holds a car whose content is
neither on the disc nor installed.

Not reproduced (2026-10-14): base build with the normal profile and with the Xenia save,
signed in or not, START pressed at once or after the attract screens; TU4 build with the
Xenia save. Every IsCarInstalled answer was 1 (`FORZA_DLC_LOG=1`). The message can only
come from a garage car the game does not count as installed: a car from a package that is
not installed in the user data folder the game uses (`<user data>/0000000000000000/
4D5309C9/00000002`; `play.sh --xenia` and the launcher link it into the Xenia copy), or a
package installed without its header (`Headers/00000002/<name>.header`). With
`FORZA_DLC_LOG=1` the log names the car: a line `IsCarInstalled(id N, type 1) = 0`.
