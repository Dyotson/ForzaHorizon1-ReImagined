# Texture packs (#384)

Higher-resolution textures without touching the game's files: the renderer recognises a
texture the game loads by a fingerprint of its contents, and draws a file named after that
fingerprint instead. The game itself never sees the file; it keeps its own texture, in its own
memory, and only the graphics card's copy changes.

A **texture pack** is a folder of such files. Packs come from two places, and the project hosts
neither (they are derived from the game's art):

- **Make HD pack**: the launcher upscales the textures *you* dumped, on your PC, with an AI
  upscaler (Real-ESRGAN). Nothing of the game is downloaded or shared.
- **Community packs**: packs other players made by hand, added with **Add pack…**.

## The Texture packs page

The launcher's **Texture packs** page (also **Settings > Display > Texture packs > Texture packs
page…**):

| Launcher | cvar | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use texture packs | `texture_replace` | Draws the ticked packs' textures (Vulkan) |
| Dump textures | `texture_dump` | Saves each texture the game loads, once, to `textures/dump/` |
| The list of packs | `texture_packs` | The packs to use, in order (the launcher passes it) |
| Open textures folder | | Opens `textures/` in the game's data folder |

Both switches are off by default, are the same settings as in Settings > Display, and apply from
the next start. The folder is `textures` in the game's data folder
(`~/.local/share/forza/textures` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ForzaReImagined\textures` on
Windows): the launcher passes it as `texture_pack_root`; without the launcher it is
`<user_data_root>/textures`. Other cvars, for `forza.toml` or the command line:

- `texture_dump_png` (on): with `texture_dump`, also write a `.png` of the largest level.
- `texture_replace_preload` (off): read every pack file at start instead of when its texture
  first loads, so no texture is shown at the original resolution first (more memory).
- `texture_pack_root`: another folder (the launcher then passes no `texture_packs`).

### The list

Each folder in `textures/` is a pack (not `dump/`, nor folders starting with a dot). The list
shows its name, author and version (from its `pack.toml`), its textures and how much graphics
memory they take when all are in use; tick a pack to use it (Return, Enter or a controller's A on
the selected row too). **Ticked packs are used from top to bottom: when two packs replace the
same texture, the one lower in the list wins** (as on the Mods page). The details under the list
name the textures a pack shares with others and whose copy is used. **Move up**, **Move down**,
**Remove** (asks first; a linked folder loses only the link) and **Refresh** work as on the Mods
page. The pack Make HD pack writes, "HD pack (made on this PC)" (`hd-pack`), starts at the top, so
hand-made packs below it win over it.

launcher.json keeps the order and the packs turned off (`"texture_packs": {"order": [...],
"disabled": [...]}`). With Use texture packs on, every start passes
`--texture_packs=<pack>|<pack>` with the ticked packs in order (`|` alone: none), unless
**Extra command-line flags** name `texture_packs` or `texture_pack_root`. The game reads only
those folders (SDK patch 0310); without the option (the game started without the launcher) it
reads every folder in `textures/` but `dump/`, the first path in alphabetical order winning.

Texture files directly in `textures/` (where milestone 1 told you to put them) keep working: they
are listed as **Loose files (textures folder)**, always first, so every pack wins over them for the
same texture. Untick them to turn them off; they cannot be moved or removed on the page (move or
delete the files in the folder). The launcher passes them as `.` in `texture_packs` (the files in
the folder itself, not in its folders).

### Add pack…

**Add pack…** takes a **Zip file…** or a **Folder…** (dropping either on the page does the same).
The pack is the folder that has `pack.toml` or texture files at its top, the zip's or folder's top
or the one folder inside it; it is named after that folder (a zip with its files at the top: the
zip's name). Only files named `<fingerprint>.dds` or `.png` and the pack's text files (`.txt`,
`.md`, `.toml`: read-me, licence, `pack.toml`) are copied; anything else in the zip is left out.
The files are unpacked into a hidden `.adding-*` folder in `textures/`, checked as the game reads
them, and moved into place only when the pack is usable; a pack of the same name is replaced
only after you say yes (never while the game runs).

Refused, in words under the list: a zip with an absolute path, `..` or a link (zip slip), more
than 200,000 files or 32 GB unpacked, a texture over 2 GB, a texture dump (a folder with
`index.tsv`: the game's own textures), and a pack without a single texture the game can use. A
pack named `hd-pack` or `dump` is added as `hd-pack (added)` (those folders are Make HD pack's
and the dump's). Kept, with a note: files the game cannot use (a cube map, a format it does not
read, a size over 16384, a file shorter than its header), files not named by a fingerprint, a
texture in a pack twice, and files that are byte for byte the game's own dumped textures (they
change nothing, and a pack must not contain them).

## Make HD pack

**Make HD pack** upscales your dump into the pack "HD pack (made on this PC)" (`textures/hd-pack`),
at **2x** (default) or **4x**. Turn on **Dump textures**, play where you want sharper textures (a
race from the festival dumps about 1,300), then press **Make HD pack**. It runs in the background
(the rest of the launcher and Play work meanwhile; the game can run, more slowly while both use
the graphics card), with a progress bar, the time left and **Cancel**. What is made stays: the next
**Make HD pack** (then named **Continue HD pack**) goes on from there. A pack made at another scale
is replaced after you say yes. Before it starts, the page says how many textures it will upscale,
how big the pack will be on disk and in graphics memory, and how long it takes on a mid-range card;
it warns on an integrated or small graphics card, and when the pack would take more than 40% of the
card's memory.

What it upscales, from the dump's `index.tsv`:

- **Colour textures only.** DXT5A/BC4 and 8-bit textures (one channel: masks), DXN/BC5 and 8_8
  textures (two channels: normal maps) are left as they are: an RGB upscaler would ruin their
  data. So are colour textures that look like normal maps (red and green around the middle, blue
  high) or data maps (channels used as masks: most values at 0 or 255 and many texels pure red,
  green or yellow, like the game's blend maps).
- **Not small ones**: a side under 32 or under 64x64 in all (UI bits, solid colours, ramps).
- **Sizes**: 2x or 4x, same aspect ratio; a side is never made longer than 4096 (a 2048 texture
  at 4x becomes 4096, at 2x stays out).
- **Alpha** is kept: the colour under transparent black texels (BC1 cut-outs: foliage, fences) is
  filled from the texels around them before upscaling, so edges do not turn dark; the alpha
  channel is scaled smoothly on its own. Opaque textures are written without alpha.
- **Colours**: the model shifts colours a little (darker, less saturated); each texture's mean and
  contrast per channel are matched back to the original's over the texels it shows (not the filled
  cut-out holes), so upscaled and original textures still match side by side. New detail stays.
- **Files**: `hd-pack/<fingerprint>.png` (the game makes the mips) and a `pack.toml` with the
  scale. Each is written to a temporary file and renamed, so a cancelled or interrupted run
  leaves no half-written texture.

### The upscaler

The launcher downloads the archive for your system the first time you press Make HD pack (after
asking), checks its SHA-256 against the one pinned in `launcher/forza_launcher/pins.py` (the release
predates GitHub's asset checksums; the pinned hashes match nixpkgs' package of the same archive and
other projects' pins), keeps only the program and its model (plus `vcomp140.dll`, Microsoft's OpenMP
runtime, on Windows) in `<data folder>/tools/realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan-20220424` with a `SOURCE.txt`
naming the source and licences, and deletes the archive. Before every run each file is checked
against the SHA-256 recorded when it was unpacked; a changed file is not run. The project's
repository and releases never contain the upscaler.

### Measured

Ryzen 7 7800X3D with a Radeon RX 9060 XT (16 GB, Linux, RADV), the dump of a festival race (1,228
textures): 738 upscaled, 490 left as they are (423 small, 25 masks, 22 normal maps, 20 data maps:
the red and green blend maps). The times are for 758 textures (the data maps were still upscaled
then); the game runs are the race of the Cost section below (`tools/perf_scenario.sh race` inputs,
720p, 3 minutes, 30 fps cap), one each.

| | Without packs | HD pack 2x | HD pack 4x |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Making the pack | | 9 min 4 s | 9 min 50 s |
| On disk | | 369 MB | 1.3 GB |
| Graphics memory of the whole pack | | 1.6 GB | 6.4 GB |
| In the race: textures drawn from the pack, their graphics memory | | 725, 1,604 MiB | 718, 6,172 MiB |
| Race: fps, p99 frame (`PERF` race line) | 29.7, 53.4 ms | 29.7, 34.9 ms | 29.7, 35.7 ms |
| Minute 3 (racing): fps, 1% low, worst frame | 29.8, 18.2, 152 ms | 30.0, 29.3, 34 ms | 30.0, 29.1, 38 ms |
| The card's used memory at its peak (all programs) | 4.1 GB | 7.4 GB | 11.8 GB |

The frame rate held the game's 30 fps with either pack (the run without packs had one 152 ms
hitch, which is noise: the packs add no work per frame). The replacements are read on a worker and
uploaded at 32 MiB a frame, so at 4x they come in more slowly (401 of 610 read in the second
minute, against 523 at 2x). The card's used memory is the driver's total (the desktop and a
browser held 1.3 GB before the first run, and the driver gave memory back slowly between runs, so
the later runs' peaks include up to 3 GB left over); the pack's own share is the line above it.
What changes: tiled ground textures (road, gravel, dirt) lose their DXT blocks and gain fine
grit, rock faces get sharper cracks, bark and foliage cards show more detail; from the chase
camera at 1440p the difference is clear on the near road and foliage, small on distant terrain.

## Making and sharing a pack

A pack is a folder:

```
Rocks HD/
  pack.toml            name = "Rocks HD", version = "1.0", author = "you", description = "..."
  README.md            optional: what it changes, your licence
  b5fcb5a5a9d78d71.dds the replacement of the dumped texture b5fcb5a5a9d78d71
  terrain/1808870a1806a9d5.png   folders inside are fine
```

1. Turn on **Dump textures** and play where the textures you want to change are. Each texture is
   in `textures/dump/` as `<fingerprint>.dds` and `.png` (to look at), listed in `index.tsv`.
2. Make your replacement from the dumped file (paint it, redraw it, make it larger) and save it
   with **the same file name** in your pack folder, as described below (same aspect ratio; DDS
   BC1/BC3/BC7 with mips is smallest in graphics memory, PNG works too).
3. Put the folder in `textures/` (or **Add pack…**), tick it, turn on **Use texture packs** and play.
4. To share it, zip the folder. Name the files by fingerprint only; the fingerprint is the same on
   every PC and in every run.

**Sharing is your responsibility.** A pack holds changed game art, which belongs to the game's
publisher; the project does not host packs and cannot vouch for any. Share only your own work:
never the game's textures unchanged, the dumped files, files only re-saved or converted from them,
or a dump; and keep the pack Make HD pack made on your PC to yourself (it is the game's art run
through a program, not your work). The launcher notes files of an added pack that are the game's
own textures unchanged.

## Dumping

With **Dump textures** on, drive where the textures you want to replace are. Each texture is
written once (also across runs: the files already in `dump/` are skipped) as

- `textures/dump/<fingerprint>.dds`: the texture as the game has it, with all its mip levels,
  in the matching DDS format (DXT1/3/5, ATI1/ATI2 for BC4/BC5, RGBA8, R8 or RG8);
- `textures/dump/<fingerprint>.png`: its largest level, decoded, to browse;
- a line in `textures/dump/index.tsv`: fingerprint, the game's format, size, mip levels, file
  format.

The fingerprint is 16 hexadecimal digits, for example `b5fcb5a5a9d78d71`. It is a hash
(xxHash3) of the texture's largest level as the game wrote it to memory (tiled, big-endian;
only the texels' blocks, not the padding around them, which holds whatever the memory held
before) plus its format, size, pitch, tiling and endianness. Where the texture is in memory is
not part of it, so it is the same in every run and on every PC; nor are its smaller mip levels
(the game binds some textures with different mip counts).

What is dumped: 2D textures in the formats DXT1, DXT2/3, DXT4/5, DXN, DXT5A, 8, 8_8 and
8_8_8_8, from 8x8 up. Skipped, and counted in the log: render targets the GPU drew (shadows,
reflections, the screen), screen-sized textures (1280x720 and its halves: render targets the
game reads back), textures the game rewrites as it runs (reloaded three times, each within a
second: videos, gauges), cube maps, 3D textures and arrays, and the other formats (5_6_5,
4_4_4_4, CTX1 and the float and depth formats) for now.

A race from the festival (3 minutes from the start) dumps about 1,300 textures, 190 MB (90 MB
of DDS files, 100 MB of PNGs); a free-roam drive from there adds about 700. The files are
untiled and written on a worker thread. If the game loads textures faster than they are
written (4,096 or 256 MiB waiting), the rest are not dumped this time and the log says how
many: they are dumped the next time they load.

## Making a replacement

Put a file named `<fingerprint>.dds` or `<fingerprint>.png` in a pack folder in `textures/`
(folders inside it are fine), or directly in `textures/` (the loose files). Keep the name of the
dumped texture you started from.

- **Size**: any, as long as the aspect ratio is the same (a 512x256 texture can become
  1024x512 or 4096x2048, within a texel). Up to 16384.
- **Mip levels**: optional. A `.png`, or an uncompressed DDS without mips, gets them made
  (box filter). A block-compressed DDS (BC1-BC7) is used with the levels it has: include
  them, or the texture shimmers in the distance.
- **Channels**: as in the dumped file. Single-channel textures (8, DXT5A) are read from red;
  two-channel ones (8_8, DXN: normal maps) from red and green. Alpha comes from the file.
- **Formats**: DDS with BC1 (DXT1), BC2 (DXT3), BC3 (DXT5), BC4 (ATI1, BC4U), BC5 (ATI2, BC5U),
  BC7 (DX10 header), RGBA8 or BGRA8 (32-bit RGB masks, or DXGI R8G8B8A8/B8G8R8A8), R8
  (luminance, or DXGI R8) and RG8 (DXGI R8G8, or luminance + alpha); sRGB variants are read as
  the plain ones, as the game applies its own gamma. PNG: 8 bits per channel (16-bit images are
  reduced), any colour type. Not supported: cube maps, arrays, volume textures, other DXGI
  formats.
- **Row padding** (uncompressed DDS): rows are read packed unless the header's pitch
  (`DDSD_PITCH`) says otherwise. Rows padded to 4 bytes are read in every mip level (as
  Direct3D 9 tools write them); other padding only in a file without mips. A header whose pitch
  is shorter than a row, or a file shorter than its header says, is not used (the log says
  why).
- When both a `.dds` and a `.png` exist in a pack, the `.dds` is used; the same name twice in a
  pack, the first path in alphabetical order; in two packs, the later pack's (see the list).

The replacement shows from the frame after it is read (a worker reads and decodes it the first
time its texture loads, and the frame start uploads it): the original is drawn until then,
without a stall. The log names the first replacements it uses, and every file it cannot use
and why (a wrong aspect ratio, an unsupported format).

## Limits

- Replacing needs the Vulkan renderer; Direct3D 12 dumps only.
- A texture the game samples as signed data keeps its original (the replacement is only bound
  where the game reads it unsigned, which is how it reads colour textures).
- The game's own texture still loads (its memory and its copy on the graphics card), so a
  replacement adds graphics memory; replacements stay loaded until the game exits. The log's
  summary line counts them (`MiB of GPU memory`).
- The mip level the GPU picks follows the replacement's size, so the distance where a texture
  turns blurry moves out, as it should; the game's mip clamps (`mip_min_level`) are levels of
  the new image, a little sharper than before.
- Only what the list above dumps can be replaced: no cube maps (sky, reflections), 3D textures
  or other formats yet.

## The log

At most once a minute while something happens; the counts are since the start:

```
Texture packs: command processor time 6.4 ms (1.70 ms since the last summary; hashing 5.8 ms,
dump copies 0.0 ms; at most 924 us for a load); 1902 loads fingerprinted (107.0 MiB); dumped 0
(0.0 MiB written, 0 queued, 0 dropped, 0 failed); replacements for 22 textures (22 files read,
0 not usable, 22 uploaded, 66.8 MiB of GPU memory); textures skipped: 3 format, 6
cube/3D/array/scaled, 27 screen-sized, 51 dynamic, 0 mips only, 59 tiny; 164 GPU-written loads;
formats not handled: k_32_FLOAT 1, k_24_8 1, k_2_10_10_10 1
```

The command processor time is what fingerprinting cost the thread that feeds the GPU (every
frame waits for it): it runs when a texture's data loads (created, or reloaded after the game
wrote its memory), never per draw. With both options off it does not run at all.

## Cost

Measured on a Ryzen 7 7800X3D with a Radeon RX 9060 XT (Linux), TU4, a copy of the Xenia
save, warm shader cache, alone on the machine: one run of each from boot to the festival race
at the spawn and 26 s of racing (`tools/perf_scenario.sh race` inputs; about 3 minutes, 5,400
frames). "Texture pack time" is the summary line's command processor time; "per draw" the
`GPU minute` line's command processor CPU time per draw in minutes 2 (loading, free roam, the
race's start) and 3 (racing), which evens out the runs' different draw counts:

| | Texture pack time | A frame on average | Longest load | CPU per draw, minute 2 / 3 | Race p99 frame |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Both off | not run (one test per texture load) | 0 | | 1.71 / 1.57 us | 34.3 ms |
| Use texture packs (28 files, 22 used) | 6.4 ms (hashing 5.8 ms) | 1.2 us | 0.9 ms | 1.67 / 1.58 us | 36.3 ms |
| Dump textures (empty folder, 1,226 dumped) | 36.1 ms (hashing 5.8 ms, copies 28.3 ms) | 6.7 us | 3.1 ms | 1.73 / 1.61 us | 36.5 ms |

Hashing costs about 3 us per texture load (1,900 loads, 107 MiB in the run); dumping adds a
copy of each new texture's data, once (up to 3 ms for one load). The frame rate held 30 fps in
all three; the differences per draw are noise.

## Code

SDK patch 0280 (`docs/sdk_patches.md`): `src/graphics/pipeline/texture/pack.{h,cpp}` (cvars,
fingerprint, the dump writer with its untiling, DDS and PNG encoders, the replacement reader and
its two worker threads), the hook in `TextureCache::CommitPreparedTextureLoad`, and the Vulkan
texture cache's replacement images (`VulkanTextureCache::UploadTexturePackReplacement`,
`GetTexturePackView`). SDK patch 0310: `texture_packs`, the packs to read in order, `.` for the loose files
(`ParsePackOrder` in `pack_format.cpp`, tested by `tools/test_texture_pack_dds.cpp`). The game
sets `texture_pack_root` (`src/forza_app.h`); the launcher's options are in
`launcher/forza_launcher/schema.py`, the packs in `texture_packs.py` (tests:
`launcher/test_texture_packs.py`), Make HD pack in `hd_pack.py` (tests: `launcher/test_hd_pack.py`,
with a stand-in for the upscaler), the page in `ui/texture_packs_page.py` (its list is the Mods
page's, `ui/mods_page.py` `FolderListPage`).
