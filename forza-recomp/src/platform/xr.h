// forza - VR through OpenXR (docs/vr.md, #333): a session on the headset next to the desktop
// window, which keeps showing the game.
//
// vr_mode = off (default): nothing here runs and no OpenXR library is loaded.
// vr_mode = screen: the game's picture on a virtual screen (an OpenXR quad layer, 2.2 x 1.24 m
//   at 2.5 m in front of the seat: 47 degrees wide), redrawn at the headset's rate.
// vr_mode = cockpit: as screen, but in the in-car view the head pose turns and moves the camera
//   inside the car (hooks/vr_head_pose.cpp) and the picture becomes a projection layer drawn
//   for the pose it was rendered with (the runtime reprojects head motion between game frames).
//   The game draws exactly the eyes' fields of view plus a margin (an axis pitched to their
//   middle, and a projection aspect that need not be the picture's), its camera physics (shake,
//   G-force lean, speed field of view) off. Mono: both eyes see the same image. Other cameras,
//   menus and loading stay on the screen. Pads keep working while the desktop window has no
//   focus (ReIGlue 0392).
//
// The OpenXR runtime creates the Vulkan instance and device and picks the GPU (ReIGlue 0390);
// the newest guest output reaches this thread with the tag of the frame it shows (ReIGlue
// 0391). Any failure (no loader, no runtime, no headset, a lost session) logs one line that
// starts with "VR:" and the game goes on flat.
