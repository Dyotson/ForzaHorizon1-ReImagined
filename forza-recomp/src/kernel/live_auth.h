// forza - signed requests to the Forza Live server (#515), the game's side (live_auth.cpp).
//
// No secret of ours is sent: the HELLO signs the server's challenge and every title service call
// is signed with our Live identity's Ed25519 key (live_signing.h, ed25519.h; server/forza_auth.py
// has the server's side), and servers keep only the public key. The server's WELCOME tells its
// clock and how our XUID is bound there. The friends key goes out once, to the main server, to
// move a binding a game before signed requests made with it; a server that does not know signed
// requests (a community server on an older version) gets a key made from the friends key and the
// server's name, and the main server nothing.
