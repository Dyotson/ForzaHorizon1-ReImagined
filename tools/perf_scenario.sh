#   menu      boot, title screen, START, main menu
#   drive     a profile that has not finished the prologue: main menu, Single Player,
#             the festival intro video (skipped), then the opening drive at full throttle
#   freeroam  a profile in free roam: main menu, the "MISSING CONTENT" notice, Single Player, 90 s
#             of free roam driving (use FORZA_XUID and --user_data_root for a copied save)
#   race      the user's Xenia save (as freeroam): free roam, the GoPro Millennia Masters
#             sign-up at the spawn point, the race with the throttle held RACE_SECS (26) s
#             from the countdown; screenshots every ~1.6 s (race clock, speedometer) and the
#             cars' positions in DIR/cars.txt (tools/carlog.py)
#   cold      runs with an empty shader cache (--cache_root=DIR/cache_cold); warm (default)
#             uses the normal one.
# Intro videos are skipped with START/A through the input FIFO as they start; each scene
# is labelled once it is reached (SCENE:<name>), so loading and videos stay out of the
# scene's numbers.
#
# Results are only valid on an idle machine: other jobs share it. The script records
# other game processes (reach, forza), the 1-minute load average and MemAvailable at the
# start and the end, and prints "BENCH: ... status=CONTENDED" if another game ran or the
# load average was above 2 before the run. Take a clean window (BENCH_LOCK) for numbers
# that go into docs/perf.md.
# Above 30 fps the FRAMETIME lines (main-loop dt) are printed too.
# PERF_CPUPROF=1 also samples the CPU during the measured scene (src/debug/cpu_profile.cpp)
# into DIR/cpuprof.txt; summarize with tools/cpuprof_report.py.
# PERF_CPUSET=0-3 runs the game's threads on those CPUs only (taskset; a smaller CPU, docs/perf.md
# "Low-end CPUs"). PERF_THREADS=1 samples every thread's CPU time, run-queue wait and switches
# and the game's GPU time each second into DIR/threads.jsonl, the scene's start and end into
# DIR/marks.txt; summarize with tools/thread_stats.py report DIR.
# Prints the BENCH line and the PERF lines; the log stays in DIR.
