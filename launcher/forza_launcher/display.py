"""The "Match display" frame rate (#215): the refresh rate of the monitor the game will use.

The setting is `frame_rate = 0`; the launcher turns it into a number whenever it writes forza.toml or
checks the PC's specs, so the game only ever sees a plain rate. Nothing here needs a running game.

Monitor numbering: the game's `monitor` setting is 0 or 1 for the primary display, 2 for the second, and
so on. SDL counts displays in its own order, Qt in the system's. We list the primary screen first and the
others in Qt's order, which agrees with SDL on Windows and on a typical Linux desktop; with three or more
monitors the order may differ, and then the label shows the rate of the monitor Qt calls that number.
