"""Every forza.toml key the launcher manages.

Each entry is a ReXGlue SDK cvar or one this project defines in forza-recomp/src (frame_rate,
live_server, the Horizon World switches, ...). A cvar can be set in forza.toml next to the game
binary or as --name=value on the command line; the launcher writes forza.toml. A key that
holds its default is not written, so the file stays small. `default` is what "unset" means
for the game (a few use 0/"" as "automatic").
