"""Texture packs (#384): folders of replacement textures in <data>/textures, each file named by
the fingerprint of the game texture it replaces (docs/texture_packs.md).

Each pack is a folder in the textures folder: <fingerprint>.dds or .png files (in folders inside
it too) and an optional pack.toml (name, version, author, description). The game's own dump
(textures/dump) is not a pack. launcher.json keeps the order and the packs turned off
("texture_packs": {"order": [...], "disabled": [...]}, the Mods page's format); with Use texture
packs on, the game gets the packs to use as --texture_packs (folders '|'-separated, a later one
winning for the same texture: SDK patch 0310). "hd-pack" is the pack Make HD pack writes
(hd_pack.py); it starts at the top of the list, so the packs below it win.

Texture files directly in the textures folder (milestone 1's layout) are the implicit pack
"Loose files (textures folder)" (folder "."; the game reads "." as the files in the folder
itself, not its folders): always first, so every pack wins over it; it can be turned off, not
moved or removed."""
